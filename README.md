# SimpleDeploy

This project is simple showcase how to:

- Containerize a minimal Flask app
- Deploy it on AWS using Terraform and Ansible
- Automate the process with a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions

The [Flask app](https://github.com/peter-w-remote/FlaskApp) I'm going to deploy is essentially a "Hello, World!" in Flask.  
It is meant to be developed into something more useful when the CI/CD pipeline is in place.
